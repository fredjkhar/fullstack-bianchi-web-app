# fullstack-bianchi-web-app

## About

The project is a full-stack application that streamlines the booking process for hair salon clients. Users can effortlessly read about the barbershop, its services, and location before scheduling an appointment. The front-end is a user-friendly React Single Page Application with localization features. The back-end is a straightforward Spring Boot application that handles booking storage in a Postgres database.

The primary objective of this project is to enhance and showcase my web development expertise.
